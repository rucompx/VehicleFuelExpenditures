It would enable the user to monitor and calculate data on vehicle fuel consumption by date, starting mileage, distance traveled, fuel in liters, and total fuel consumption. Computed automatically would be:

Average consumption per 100 km: to calculate how many liters of fuel a car consumes per 100 km.
Average consumption cumulative: This would be useful in monitoring fuel efficiency over some time, therefore enabling users to obtain information on trends in fuel usage and efficiency over several trips.
This helps monitor performance and will be useful for optimizing fuel economy.
